Made during the fist year of my study.
Features:
- An ATM interface
- A RFID reader
- Receipt printer support
- Server with accounts, money and cash machine control
- An interconnect server to other banking projects (our team made it)
- A cash dispenser
- Easter eggs like playing the Mario game with the keypad
- And many jokes which are quite bad
