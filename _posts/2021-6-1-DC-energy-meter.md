team was asked to develop an energy meter for the company DC systems. DC systems specializes in innovative DC energy solutions. They requested an energy meter with 700V(max 1000V) and bidirectional 16A capabilities.

We did our research, made schematics and designed the PCB. My responsibility was to make the current measuring, voltage measurement circuit and I did routing and reviewing. 

We encountered some obstacles during the PCB design, which was expected with our team of software developers. Luckily, we got everything ordered and soldered, the software was finished quickly. Also, I designed that 3d printed case, some dedication can make much difference.
